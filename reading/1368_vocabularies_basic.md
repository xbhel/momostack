## Intro

### Pick the bigger one

挑个大的 —— 使用上义词代替下义词，上义词是指那些基础词，下义词是指在基础词上衍生而来的词。如 get 就是 inherit 的上义词，inherit 是 get 的下义词，get 是大词，inherit 是小词。它们的区别就是大词可以代替小词使用，而小词不能逆向代替大词。

- Her youngest son **inherited** all her property.
- Her youngest son **got** all her property.

#### Get

大词（get）代替更多小词的例子。
- I **got** a lot of Emails every day. 我每天都收到很多邮件 (receive)。
- The policeman finally **got** him. 警察最终抓住了他 (catch)。
- I'll **get** the doctor. 我去叫医生 (call)。
- Let's **get** some fresh air. 让我们呼吸一下新鲜空气 (breathe)。
- We need to **get** the four-twenty bus if we're going to be there by six. 要想六点钟到的话，我们得搭乘四点二十的那班公交车 (ride)。

#### Think

think 可用来代替所有需要大脑工作的行为，如 suspect(怀疑)，consider(考虑)，suppose(假设)， guess(猜想)，believe(相信)，anticipate(预测)，judge(判断)，ponder(斟酌)，contemplate(沉思)。

#### Feeling

有感觉的都是 feeling。无论是肉体上的感受，还是情感上的感受，统统都可以用feeling来表达。

- I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. 我无意伤害你的感情 (emotion)。
- I still have feelings for her. 我依然爱着她 (love)。
- You have no feelings for others. 你这人没有同情心 (sympathy)。
- I got the feeling that he didn't like me much. 我觉得他不是很喜欢我 (impression)。
- I don't have any strong feelings about it. 对这事我没啥感觉 (opinion)。

#### Bad

bad 不只是坏的意思。

- I thought it was a very bad article. 我觉得这文章写得很烂 (劣质的，代替 inferior).
- Smoking gives you bad breath. 抽烟会让你有难闻的口气 (unpleasant)。
- You're a bad liar. 你好可怜，谎也不会撒 (poor)。
- He had a bad accident. 他发生了严重的事故 (serious)。
- It is a bad time to call him. 这个时间给他打电话不大合适 (inappropriate)。

**Rotten vs Rancid vs Sour**

这三个也是 bad 的下义词，这三个词都是指“食物坏了”的意思。

- rotten 是指食物腐烂了。
    - The apple is rotten.
- rancid 是指含有脂肪的食物酸败了。
    - The butter is rancid.
- sour 则是指牛奶等不新鲜了。
    - The milk is sour.

在表示“坏了”这个意思时，这些词相互之间不可以混搭, 如果你说 The apple is sour. 那就变成“这个苹果是酸的”的意思了。

### Pick a concrete term

拣个实心的 —— ”实心词”其实就是指具体的概念，而空心词则是指抽象的概念。如表达 “这是一个重要的决定”，通常情况下，我们会说成是：It is an important decision. 但在口语中，我们还可以说成：It is a big decision.

在这个例子中，important 就叫“空心词”​，而 big 就是“实心词”​。因为后者是我们可以直接体验到的，生活中有很多 big 的东西，什么 big house, big car, big city，我们通过肉眼就可以感知到什么是 big。而 important 这个词则是头脑中的概念，看不见，摸不着。

反过来说，啥叫重要？什么样的东西重要？当然，我们可以创造出像important 这样的词专门表达这个意思，但从另一个角度考虑，重要的东西一定有它的具体特点 —— 一些可以被感知的特点，要么大，要么高，要么数量多，要么位置靠前。所以，我们除了可以用big来代替 important 外，还可以用其他具体概念来代替它，比如下面这两个例子：

- If it means that much to you, I'll go find something else. (从数量角度说明重要性)
- For him, family comes before everything. (从位置角度说明重要性)

使用 size 来表达抽象的概念：
- Nobody realized the size of the problem. 没人意识到问题的严重性。
- She knows the size of the task. 她清楚任务的艰巨性。
- We were shocked at the size of his debts. 他欠了那么多钱，把我们给吓到了。
