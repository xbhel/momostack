## Success in Life

Success means different things for different people. Some may equate it with fame, some with wealth and still some with accomplishments. For me, it means fulfilling one's dreams whatever your dreams are, you have a goal there and then focus all your attention on it.

Dreams bring you hope and happiness. In the process of Struggling for it, you cry, sweat, complain or even curse, but the joy of harvesting makes you forget all the pains and troubles you have gone through. So an old proverb says that the sweetest fruit is one that has undergone the bitterest ordeal.

There are several keys to success. First, your goal must be practical and practicable. If you set your goal too high, chances are that you will never attain it. Next, you have to make a plan of doing it. You can take some steps to realize it. Since the process is quite tough, you need to be diligent, patient and persevering.

Even if you meet with some difficulties or frustrations, just take them in your stride. You can always tell yourself that there is nothing insurmountable. With this will and determination, success is sure to wait for you at the end of the tunnel!

## Learning: a Lifelong Career

As food is to the body, so is learning to the mind. Our bodies grow and muscles develop with the intake of food. Likewise, we should keep learning day by day to maintain our mental power and expand our intellectual capacity.

Constant learning supplies us with fuel for driving us to sharpen our power of reasoning, analysis, and judgment. Continuous learning is the best way to keep pace with the times in the information age.

It is a common misunderstanding to regard school as the only place for the acquisition of knowledge. On the contrary, learning should be an endless process, from the cradle to the grave. With the world changing so fast, to stop learning for just a few days will make a person lag behind.

Lack of learning will inevitably lead to the stagnation of the mind, or even worse, its fossilization. Therefore, to stay mentally young, we have to take learning as a lifelong career.
